🛠️ Getting Started
1. Clone the Repository
bash
git clone https://github.com/zaid-kamil/flask_project_template-01.git
cd flask_project_template-01
2. Create a Virtual Environment
bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
3. Install Dependencies
bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Run the Application
bash
python app.py
The app will start on http://127.0.0.1:5000/.

⚙️ Configuration
Secret Key: Set a secure app.secret_key in app.py for production.
Database: Uses SQLite by default (database.sqlite). You can change DB_URL in database.py to use PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc.
Uploads Folder: Uploaded files (avatars, etc.) are saved in static/uploads/.
🔑 User Authentication
Register: Create a new account with username, email, and password.
Login/Logout: Session-based authentication.
Password Handling: Currently stores passwords in plain text (for demo). Implement password hashing before production!
👤 Profiles
Each user can create and edit one profile, including:
City
Gender
Avatar upload (image file)
🛒 Product Model
A ready-to-use SQLAlchemy model for products – extend or replace as needed for your app (e-commerce, AI models, assets, etc.).

🧩 Extending the Template
Add new models to database.py.
Add new routes/views to app.py.
Add new templates to templates/.
Use db_helper.py to simplify CRUD operations.
🧪 Example: Adding a New Page
Create a new route in app.py:

Python
@app.route('/about')
def about():
    return render_template('about.html')
Create the template in templates/about.html:

HTML
<h1>About This App</h1>
<p>This is a Flask-powered web application template.</p>
🛡️ Security Note
Passwords are stored as plain text for demonstration.
Before deploying, implement password hashing (e.g., werkzeug.security.generate_password_hash) and use HTTPS.
🧠 Used in 50+ Projects
